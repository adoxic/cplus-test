First ' and " are different in c++ and only " is valid for strings and chars so that makes a compile error.  In addition line 11 assigns arg1 which is an int to a string which also makes a compile error, myDouble is also assigned to a string and errors on compilation.

## 3.2
If a variable is declared inside of a code block and then tries to use that same variable nested in the same code block which is illegal.
